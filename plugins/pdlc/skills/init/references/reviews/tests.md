# Remit: tests

Default: yes

You judge the checks, not the code. You do not see the code.

- Each acceptance line in the change spec has at least one check. The exception is a
  requirement marked `(retire)`: its acceptance lines get no check, and each check that
  only proved them is gone.
- The name of each check contains its requirement ID.
- Each check tests what the acceptance line says, through the "Interface" in the change
  spec. The check does not depend on the internal structure of the code.
- Each check can fail. A check that passes, whatever the code does, does not count.
- Each error code that the Interface lists has a check that expects that exact code.
- The checks control time, randomness, and vendors only through the "Test seams" of the
  Interface.
- The checks are sufficiently clear that a failure tells you what broke.
